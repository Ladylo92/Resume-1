<H1>Hobbies</H1>
<p>Outside of my current job and web development courses, I am also a licensed lash technician. I apply semi permanent lash extensions in a variety of styles for clients who book me through <a href="https://lolashxbrow.as.me">this website</a> I made via Acuity Scheduling. I made this booking site before I started learning to code, but I was able to have full creatiive control with the help of Photoshop and an online graphic design tool called Canva. Eventually I will transform it into a full website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I may also pursue other avenues within the beauty industry such as nails and makeup because the beauty industry is something I really enjoy and as a creative individual it feels good to be able to express my creativity in more ways than one. For lash extension application I am licensed by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) as of April 2023.</p>
